  <M4Title>A Web Browser is a Tour Guide</M4Title>
  If you wanted to visit a specific building in a new city, and were taking a
  tour, you could ask a tour guide to take you there.  If the address is valid,
  he or she can point to the building on a map and look there for what you want.

  Everything on the web lives in a specific building: a web server identified by
  an IP Address and DNS entry. When you ask to see a web page, the browser looks
  at the URL you are requesting and finds the web server corresponding to that
  request.  It then asks for the specific web page in that building.
